**Testing**

- When test fails, first look at intent.yaml, then verify that test and implementation is used accordingly to intent. Then try to fix it.
- For UI testing, use golden and integration tests exclusively. Unit tests should only be used for business logic, commands, types and handlers. Test only nehaviour, not how many widgets.
- If there is no mock, create it to reuse it.
- Always add to mock classes suffix `Mock` and to file - suffix `_mock`
- wrap goldenTest in unawaited function
- Use shared mockes relative to type, do not create over and over the same.
- to run: 
  - unit tests: `make test`
  - golden tests: `make test-golden`
