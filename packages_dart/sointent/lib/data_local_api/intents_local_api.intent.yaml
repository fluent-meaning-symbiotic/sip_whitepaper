semantic_intent:
  name: IntentsLocalApi
  type: SemanticApiIntent
  version: 1
  meaning: |
    Local API for managing semantic intents following SIP principles.
    Provides core functionality for loading, saving, and managing intent files
    while maintaining semantic relationships and integrity.

    Core responsibilities:
    - Loading intents recursively from directories
    - Saving intents to files with proper validation
    - Managing intent file paths and relationships
    - Handling YAML serialization/deserialization
    - Maintaining semantic integrity during file operations

    file_operations:
      - name: getRecursiveIntents
        params:
          - name: dirPath
            type: String
            description: Directory path to scan for intents
        returns: List<SemanticIntentFile>
        validation: DirectoryExists

      - name: saveIntent
        params:
          - name: path
            type: String
            description: Path to save the intent file
          - name: intent
            type: SemanticIntentFile
            description: Intent to save
        validation: ValidYamlStructure

      - name: getOriginalPath
        params:
          - name: intent
            type: YamlMap
            description: Intent data to get path for
        returns: String?
        validation: ValidPathFormat

  semantic_validations:
    - DirectoryExists: Ensures target directory exists and is accessible
    - ValidYamlStructure: Validates YAML structure follows SIP principles
    - ValidPathFormat: Ensures path format is valid for the system
