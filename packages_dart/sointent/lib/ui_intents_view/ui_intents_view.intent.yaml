    # Left Panel - Intents Tree View

    The process of user acting is:
    User interacts with an expandable tree view that shows the semantic intent hierarchy.
    Each folder can be expanded/collapsed to show/hide its contents.
    Paths from SemanticIntentFile.path field are used to build the tree structure.
    Each path segment represents a node in the tree.

    View (expandable tree with indentation and icons): 

    ▼ root
      ▶ semantic_intent_1/
      ▼ semantic_intent_2/
        ├── sub_intent_1
        ├── sub_intent_2
        └── sub_intent_3
      ▼ semantic_intent_5/
        ▶ sub_intent_4/
          ├── sub_sub_intent_1
          ├── sub_sub_intent_2
          └── sub_sub_intent_3
      ▶ semantic_intent_6/
      ▶ semantic_intent_7/
      ▶ semantic_intent_8/
