  version: 1
  meaning: |
    This screen serves as the application's entry point, managing initial app loading
    and providing access to the workbench functionality through a folder selection interface.
  description: |
    The screen transitions through two main states:
    1. Loading State: Shows a centered loading indicator while LoadAppCommand executes
    2. Ready State:
      Displays a neumorphic card-based folder selection interface with:
      - A primary "Open Folder" button (32px height, 10px radius)
      - A "Recent Folders" header (16px Space Grotesk, 600 weight)
      - A scrollable list of recent folder cards (16px radius, dual-layer depth)
      - Each folder card shows:
        - Folder name (14px/1.3 primary text)
        - Full path (12px/1.5 tertiary text)
      - Micro-interaction animations (120ms ease-in-out)
      - Hover and active states following neumorphic principles
