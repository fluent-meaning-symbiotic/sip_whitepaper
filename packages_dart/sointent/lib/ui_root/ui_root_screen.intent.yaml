  meaning: |
    This screen serves as the application's entry point, managing initial app loading
    and providing access to the workbench functionality through a folder selection interface.
  description: |
    The screen transitions through two main states:
    1. Loading State: Shows a centered loading indicator while LoadAppCommand executes
    2. Ready State: Displays a folder selection interface with recently opened folders
