  description: |
    The workbench screen is the primary interface for managing semantic intents.
    It uses a three-panel layout to provide a clear workflow:
    - Left panel: List of all semantic intents with search and filtering
    - Center panel: Detailed editor for the selected intent (UiIntentEditor)
    - Right panel: Command controls and actions for the selected intent (UiIntentControls)
    All panels have draggable vertical dividers in between them to allow for resizing.
