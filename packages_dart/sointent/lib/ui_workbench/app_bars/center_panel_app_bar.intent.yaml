semantic_intent:
  version: 1
  name: CenterPanelAppBarIntent
  type: SemanticUiIntent
  meaning: "App bar for the center panel (intent editor) of the workbench that displays the current intent name, actions, and panel visibility controls with hero animations"
  description: |
    Provides a header for the center panel showing the current intent being edited,
    relevant actions, and dynamic panel visibility controls.

    Panel Visibility Controls:
    - Left Chevron: Appears when left panel is hidden. When clicked, shows the left panel
      and performs a hero animation transitioning the chevron to the left panel's app bar.
    - Right Chevron: Appears when right panel is hidden. When clicked, shows the right panel
      and performs a hero animation transitioning the chevron to the right panel's app bar.

    The chevron buttons act as visual bridges between panels, using hero animations
    to create a smooth transition effect when showing/hiding panels.

    Core Actions:
    - Save changes to the current intent
    - Undo last change
    - Redo last change
