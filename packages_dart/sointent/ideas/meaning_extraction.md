1. Identify and list the core functional domains from this SemanticUiIntent, following these specific guidelines:
2. Use concise, 2-5 word phrases that directly reference the intent's core functionality
   Focus on the primary components and their management aspects
3. Use 'Intent' as a prefix for each domain to maintain consistency with Semantic Intent naming conventions
4. Prioritize concrete implementation elements that align with Semantic Intent types (Ui, Command, Type, etc.)
   Identify domains that could serve as potential Semantic Intent seeds for subgraphs
5. Consider potential Semantic Type Intents and Token Intents that could emerge from these domains
6. Exclude implementation details and focus on the 'what' rather than the 'how'
   Identify potential Semantic Test Intents that would validate these domains
   The output should be a numbered list of domain meanings that could be used as reference points in the codebase and could potentially seed new Semantic Intents.
