    and interaction patterns that reveal meaning relationships while maintaining 
    information density.

    Key innovative features:

    1. Semantic Minimap
       - Real-time force-directed graph showing domain relationships
       - Current context highlighted with cosmic glow
       - Domains sized by semantic weight
       - Smooth animations for context transitions

    2. Meaning Trails
       - Ethereal lines connecting related intents
       - Animate and glow on hover
       - Reveal semantic relationships
       - Fade in/out with elegant transitions

    3. Domain Focus
       - Subtle background highlight for domain groups
       - Related items connected with meaning trails
       - Non-related items slightly dimmed
       - Smooth transitions between focus states

    4. Dynamic Detail Levels
       - Micro view: Traditional dense tree
       - Hover view: Expanded semantic context
       - Focus view: Full domain relationships
       - Pinch to zoom between levels

    5. Semantic Breadcrumbs
       - Ultra-compact domain path
       - Reveals full context on hover
       - Shows semantic position in hierarchy
       - Animated transitions between states

    Example Interaction Flow:
    ```
    ▼ ui_domain/                    [Semantic Minimap]
      ▶ components/                  ○ ─── ○
      ▼ screens/                     │  ○  │
        ├── login_screen*         ○ ─ ○ ─ ○ ─ ○
        └── dashboard*               │  ○  │
                                    ○ ─── ○
    ```
    * On hover: 
      - Meaning trails appear connecting related items
      - Domain context expands in minimap
      - Semantic breadcrumbs show full path
      - Related implementations highlighted

    * On domain focus:
      - Non-domain items fade slightly
      - Domain items connected with meaning trails
      - Minimap zooms to show detailed relationships
      - Semantic summary appears in breadcrumbs

    * On pinch zoom:
      - Smoothly transitions between detail levels
      - Reveals more semantic context
      - Updates minimap visualization
      - Adjusts meaning trail visibility

  scratchpad_todo:
    - Implement force-directed graph for minimap
    - Create smooth animations for meaning trails
    - Design domain focus transitions
    - Build semantic breadcrumb component
    - Add pinch-to-zoom gesture handling
