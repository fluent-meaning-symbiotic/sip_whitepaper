**Writing Code Protocol**

- Place mock, test and implementation exactly near intent file.
- Export files from its folders using barrel file (ui/ui.dart, commands/commands.dart etc.).
- To find implementation, try to load intents first.
- Do not rely on strings, use enums.

- Use context.read/context.select to subscribe to observable state in build methods.
