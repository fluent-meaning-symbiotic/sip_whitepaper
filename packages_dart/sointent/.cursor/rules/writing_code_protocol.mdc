**Writing Code Protocol**

- Place mock, test and implementation exactly near intent file.
- Export files from its folders using barrel file (ui/ui.dart, commands/commands.dart etc.).
- To find implementation, try to load intents first.
- Do not rely on strings, use enums.
- Use context.read/context.select to subscribe to observable state in build methods.
- If you create new file, make sure to check its intent. If it doesn't have an intent - create it.


**Command-Resource Pattern**
- Resources are pure data containers with no business logic
- Each resource manages a specific piece of state
- Commands contain all business logic and transform data
- Commands are executed based on user actions
- Commands can read from multiple resources and can update multiple resources
- Use OrderedMapNotifier/OrderedListNotifier for collections of resources
- Use ValueNotifier for single values resources
- Follow naming: {Action}{Resource}Command for commands
- Follow naming: {Domain}Resource for resources
