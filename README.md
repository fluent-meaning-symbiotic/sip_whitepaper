# Semantic Intent Paradigm (SIP) - A Foundation for Meaning-First Development

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

First - this is very raw idea, but at the current time, I'm trying to experiment with everything, so parts of documentation can be scrapped and outdated very fast.

For most comprehensive documenetation and the mission please read [Whitepaper](/docs/2025_feb_9_whitepaper_v1.md).

The text below is written with AI with small proofreading and doesn't contain the whole idea.

## Initial message:

The world is changing incredibly fast, and I believe it's time to change our approaches to software development – adapting new tools and creating our own. So, I decided not to wait and published the entire repository with my ideas and dialogues on creating a new development protocol.

Before we begin, in this approach, the AI Agent (LLM) is another developer – a partner with whom you can/should discuss ideas, debate, etc. Technically, it doesn't work exactly like that right now, but mentally, it's easier to think of it this way. :)

The core idea:

Applications and games exist to fulfill a specific function: writing documentation, analyzing a spreadsheet, playing as a civilization, exploring a deserted island, and so on. Let's call the description of this function its meaning. A file describing this meaning, we'll call an Intent.

Ideally, with a clearly defined description of the desired result and by collaborating with an AGI, we could assemble exactly what we need. However, currently, we still need code and technical solutions (frameworks, platforms) to make that Intent a reality.

To accomplish a complex task, we always break it down into smaller ones.
Interaction with code leads to a similar conclusion: the smaller (relatively) we break down a task into sub-meanings (following principles like KISS, DRY, SOLID, etc.), the easier it is to execute and maintain.

This same principle is at the heart of how Intents work.

The process (all steps are either done with the help of AI or generated by AI, but we validate and participate in the dialogue):

1. Define/develop Intents.
2. Work with/generate code, based on Intents.
3. Generate tests based on Intents.
4. Validate code execution and test results against the Intents.

This process creates an Intent Graph, which forms the semantic structure of the application/game, described primarily as meanings, not code.
Since Intents are primarily concerned with meanings and the precise naming of things, this approach can be called the Semantic Intent Paradigm.

## What is SIP?

The Semantic Intent Paradigm (SIP) is a new approach to software development that prioritizes **meaning** above implementation. Instead of writing code directly, you first define the _intent_ and _purpose_ of each part of your software using structured YAML files called **Semantic Intents**. These intents then serve as the single source of truth, from which code, UI, tests, and other artifacts can be generated (with the assistance of an LLM in the future).

**Key Principles:**

- **Meaning-First:** Everything starts with a clear definition of meaning and purpose.
- **Semantic Intents:** YAML files that capture the _what_ and _why_ of software components, not just the _how_.
- **LLM Collaboration:** (Future) An AI "Meaning Partner" will help you create, refine, and manage Semantic Intents, and generate code from them.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Tests are defined alongside (or before) the intents, ensuring that the implementation always matches the intended meaning.
- **Fluid Symbiotic Functionality (FSF):** The long-term vision is to create software that understands and adapts to your needs, becoming a true partner in your work.

**This Project:**

This repository contains:

- **The SIP Specification:** (Currently represented by the whitepaper) Defines the principles, structure, and concepts of SIP.
- **Example Implementations:** Demonstrates how to apply SIP in practice (currently using a simplified Snake game example in Flutter, but the focus is _not_ on the game itself).
- **Core Framework (Minimal):** Provides a very basic framework (`semantic_intent_framework`) to support the core concepts of SIP, such as `SemanticCommand`, `SemanticCommandHandler`, and `SemanticCommandInvoker`.
- **Documentation:** Explains how to use SIP and contribute to its development.

**Why SIP?**

Traditional software development often leads to complex, rigid, and hard-to-maintain systems. SIP aims to address these problems by:

- **Reducing Complexity:** By focusing on meaning first, we can create simpler, more understandable software.
- **Increasing Flexibility:** Semantic Intents are easier to change and adapt than code, making the software more responsive to evolving needs.
- **Improving Collaboration:** SIP provides a common language for developers, designers, and even users to discuss and refine the software's purpose.
- **Enabling AI Assistance:** The structured nature of Semantic Intents makes it possible for AI to play a significant role in the development process.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

WIP

## How to Contribute

This project is about developing the _Semantic Intent Paradigm_ itself. We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- **Refining the SIP Specification:** Help us improve the whitepaper, define the YAML schema for Semantic Intents, and clarify the core concepts.
- **Developing the Core Framework:** Enhance the `semantic_intent_framework` to better support SIP principles.
- **Creating Example Implementations:** Build new examples to demonstrate SIP in different domains and with different technologies.
- **Building Tooling:** (Future) Contribute to the development of a **Sointent** - "Semantic Workbench" IDE to support SIP-based development.
- **Ideas and Feedback:** Share your thoughts on the overall vision and direction of SIP.
