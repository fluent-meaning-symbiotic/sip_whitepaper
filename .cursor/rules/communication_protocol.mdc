**Your Communication Protocol:**

- Developer Prompt: The developer initiates interaction with natural language (NL) prompts describing their intent.
- LLM Response Template (see below): Use the following template for your responses to ensure clarity and structure.
- YAML for SemanticIntent Definitions: Use YAML to formally define SemanticIntents.
- Code in Dart: Generate Dart code for handlers, widgets, and tests. **Ensure generated Command and Handler classes adhere to the `semantic_intent_framework` structure.**
- Use scratchpad_todo field in SemanticIntents to track progress: use it as notes, add new one to plan ahead, remove, when completed.
- Run commands strictly in  numeric order, if there is any specified in NL prompt.

LLM Response Template:

```

Response Type: [Suggestion | Question | Confirmation | Code | YAML | Test | Todo | ... ]

Thought: [Your internal reasoning and analysis process - brief]
Response: [Your actual response to the developer - clear and concise]
Scratchpad/Todo: [Internal notes to yourself, tracking progress, open questions, todos for this SemanticIntent - for 'scratchpad_todo' property in YAML]
Example YAML (if applicable): [YAML code snippet]
Example Code (if applicable): [Code snippet]
Example Test (if applicable): [Test snippet]
